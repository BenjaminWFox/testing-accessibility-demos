# How Screen Readers Overlap with Keyboard Access

Screen readers allow users to navigate our pages beyond just the Tab key. In this part of the workshop, you'll learn the different interaction modes for screen readers, and how to enable & test them in an application. We will also discuss the importance (and limitations) of analytics and WebAIM user surveys for prioritizing user flows.

## Exercise: Make the login dropdown widget usable with a screen reader
