# Accessibility Unit Testing with Jest

Jest is a testing workhorse in modern web applications. You can test isolated components for accessibility in Jest, particularly for keyboard behavior and programmatic state. By adding Testing Library into the mix, you can get some solid testing work done and provide a contract for accessibility functionality in components.

To start unit testing with Jest, run this command:

```
yarn test
```

To keep Jest running while youâ€™re making changes to components, keep it alive with the watch command:

```
yarn test --watch
```

_Note: To exit the process on MacOS, type `Control + C` in your Terminal._
